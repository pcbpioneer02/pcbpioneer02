Introduction
This repository contains several projects built with the ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers, along with associated hardware components such as sensors, motors, relays, and other peripherals. The projects are designed to be a starting point for hobbyists, engineers, and students working with IoT and embedded systems.

Each folder in this repository includes:

Code: Firmware or software written for the ESP32/ESP8266 boards.

Schematics: Electrical diagrams for building the circuits.

PCB Designs: Printed Circuit Board (PCB) designs for custom hardware.

Hardware Files: Files for components like sensors, actuators, and modules.

Projects
Hereâ€™s a list of some of the projects included in this repository:

ESP32 Fingerprint Authentication System

Description: A fingerprint-based authentication system using the ESP32, R307 sensor, and LCD display.

Files: Code, schematic, and PCB design for a fingerprint-based attendance system.

ESP8266 Home Automation System

Description: Control home appliances using an ESP8266 with the Blynk IoT app.

Files: Code and hardware designs for controlling relays with IoT.

Automatic Matrix Sprinkler System

Description: An automated sprinkler system using an ESP32 with sensors to water plants based on moisture levels.

Files: Circuit diagrams, code, and PCB design.

ESP32 Color Sorting Machine

Description: A color sorting machine using an Arduino Nano and color sensor, controlled by an ESP32.

Files: Schematic and PCB designs, along with code for the sorting system.

ESP32 IoT Projects

Description: Various Internet of Things (IoT) projects built using the ESP32, including environmental monitoring and automation.

Files: Code and hardware files for IoT-based systems.

Install necessary dependencies:

ESP32/ESP8266 Board Support: Install the board support in the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO (whichever you are using).

Libraries: Make sure to install any required libraries, such as the Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library, Blynk, or DHT sensor library.

Open the project file (for Arduino IDE, it would be .ino), compile, and upload it to your ESP32 or ESP8266 board.

Usage
Once the code is uploaded to the board, follow these instructions for each project:

ESP32 Fingerprint Authentication: Enroll fingerprints and then use the system to authenticate users.

Home Automation: Use the Blynk app to control home devices remotely.

Matrix Sprinkler: Set up the system in your garden, and it will automatically water the plants when needed.

Color Sorting Machine: Feed items to be sorted into the system, and it will classify them based on color.

IoT Projects: Monitor data from your sensors via a web interface or cloud platform (like Blynk, Firebase, etc.).
